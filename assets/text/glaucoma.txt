What is glaucoma?
--------------------------------------------------
    Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause vision loss and blindness by damaging a nerve in the back of your eye called the optic nerve.  

    The symptoms can start so slowly that you may not notice them. The only way to find out if you have glaucoma is to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam.  

    There’s no cure for glaucoma, but early treatment can often stop the damage and protect your vision.

What are the types of glaucoma?
--------------------------------------------------
    There are many different types of glaucoma, but the most common type in the United States is called open-angle glaucoma — that’s what most people mean when they talk about glaucoma. Other types are less common, like angle-closure glaucoma and congenital glaucoma.

What are the symptoms of glaucoma?
--------------------------------------------------
    At first, glaucoma doesn’t usually have any symptoms. That’s why half of people with glaucoma don’t even know they have it.  

    Over time, you may slowly lose vision, usually starting with your side (peripheral) vision — especially the part of your vision that’s closest to your nose. Because it happens so slowly, many people can’t tell that their vision is changing at first. 

    But as the disease gets worse, you may start to notice that you can’t see things off to the side anymore. Without treatment, glaucoma can eventually cause blindness.

Am I at risk for glaucoma?
--------------------------------------------------
    Anyone can get glaucoma, but some people are at higher risk. You’re at higher risk if you: 

    Are over age 60, especially if you’re Hispanic/Latino 
    Are African American and over age 40 
    Have a family history of glaucoma
    
    Talk with your doctor about your risk for glaucoma, and ask how often you need to get checked. If you’re at higher risk, you need to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam every 1 to 2 years.

What’s the treatment for glaucoma?
--------------------------------------------------
Doctors use different types of treatment for glaucoma, including medicines (usually eye drops), laser treatment, and surgery.  

    If you have glaucoma, it’s important to start treatment right away. Treatment won’t undo any damage to your vision, but it can stop it from getting worse. 

        - Medicines. Prescription eye drops are the most common treatment. They lower the pressure in your eye and prevent damage to your optic nerve.
        - Laser treatment. To lower your eye pressure, doctors can use lasers to help the fluid drain out of your eye. It’s a simple procedure that your doctor can do in the office.
        - Surgery. If medicines and laser treatment don’t work, your doctor might suggest surgery. There are several different types of surgery that can help the fluid drain out of your eye.

    Talk over your options with your doctor. While glaucoma is a serious disease, treatment works well.
