What is vitreous detachment?
--------------------------------------------------
Vitreous detachment occurs when the gel-like fluid (vitreous) inside the eye pulls away from the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This condition is common among people over 50 and may not always cause noticeable symptoms.

Symptoms, if present, may include floaters (dark spots or lines that move across the field of vision) and flashes of light in the peripheral vision.

What are the symptoms of vitreous detachment?
--------------------------------------------------
    - Floaters (small dark spots or squiggly lines in the vision)
    - Flashes of light in the peripheral vision

    These symptoms may suggest the need for a dilated eye exam to evaluate any potential complications associated with vitreous detachment.

When to see a doctor?
--------------------------------------------------
    Seek immediate medical attention if you experience sudden onset or worsening of floaters, flashes of light, or other changes in vision. These symptoms could indicate more serious conditions such as retinal tears or detachment.

    Regular eye exams, particularly for individuals over 50 or those who are nearsighted, can aid in early detection of vitreous detachment.

What are the causes of vitreous detachment?
--------------------------------------------------
    Vitreous detachment typically occurs due to aging, where the vitreous gel gradually shrinks and pulls away from the retina. Factors contributing to vitreous detachment include:

        - Aging process: As individuals age, changes in the vitreous gel structure increase the likelihood of detachment.
        - Nearsightedness (myopia): Higher degrees of nearsightedness can increase the risk of vitreous detachment.
        - Previous eye surgery or injury: These factors may predispose individuals to vitreous detachment.

    Although vitreous detachment itself may not always require treatment, prompt evaluation by an eye care professional is essential to rule out potential complications like retinal tears or detachment.
