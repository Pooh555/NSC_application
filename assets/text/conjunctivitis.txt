What Is Pink Eye?
--------------------------------------------------
    Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva -- the thin, clear tissue that lies over the white part of the eye and lines the inside of the eyelid.

How Do You Get Pink Eye?
--------------------------------------------------
Several things could be to blame, but the most common causes of pink eye are:
    - Viruses, including the kind that causes the common cold
    - Bacteria
    - Allergens such as pollen, dust, or smoke. It could also be due to a special type of allergy that affects some people who wear contact lenses.
    - Other causes include:
        - Irritants such as shampoos, dirt, smoke, and pool chlorine
        - A reaction to eye drops
        - A reaction to wearing contact lens
        - Fungi, amoebas, and parasites
    
    Conjunctivitis sometimes results from an STD. Gonorrhea can bring on a rare but dangerous form of bacterial conjunctivitis. It can lead to vision loss if you don’t treat it. Chlamydia can cause conjunctivitis in adults. If you have chlamydia, gonorrhea, or other bacteria in your body when you give birth, you can pass pink eye to your baby through your birth canal.

    Pink eye, caused by some bacteria and viruses, can spread quickly from person to person. But it isn’t a serious health risk if diagnosed promptly. However, if it happens in a newborn, tell a doctor immediately, as it might be an infection that can affect the baby’s eyesight.

Pink Eye Types
--------------------------------------------------
Viral pink eye
    Viral pink eye is the most common and may be the most contagious form. It's usually caused by the virus that causes the common cold. It tends to start in one eye, causing lots of tears and a watery discharge. Within 24-48 hours, it affects the other eye, too. You might feel a swollen lymph node in front of your ear or under your jawbone. You may also have cold symptoms such as a fever, sore throat, and runny nose.

    Viral pink eye has no cure but will go away on its own. Your symptoms may worsen in the first 3-5 days, but you’ll get better within 1-3 weeks.

Bacterial pink eye 
    Bacteria that cause pink eye include:
        - Staphylococcus aureus
        - Streptococcus pneumoniae
        - Haemophilus influenzae
        - Moraxella catarrhalis
        - Chlamydia trachomatis
        - Neisseria gonorrhoeae

    Bacterial strains affect children more often than adults. These infections spread easily and are typically seen from December through April. Bacterial pink eye usually infects one eye but can show up in both. Your eye will release a lot of yellow, white, or green pus and mucus. If treated with antibiotic eye drops or ointment, it goes away quickly without causing eye problems. 

Allergic conjunctivitis
    Allergic pink eye may occur when allergens in the air, such as dust mites, cat dander, and pollen, enter the eye. It often occurs in people with allergic conditions such as hay fever and asthma. Symptoms such as tearing, itching, and redness in the eyes may happen suddenly, seasonally, or all year round. You might also have an itchy, runny nose and sneezing.

    It doesn’t spread from person to person, and symptoms usually go away once you’re no longer exposed to the allergen.

    You can manage allergic conjunctivitis with allergy eye drops.
