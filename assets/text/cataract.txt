What are cataracts?
--------------------------------------------------
A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of your eye (the clear part of the eye that helps to focus light). Cataracts are very common as you get older. In fact, more than half of all Americans age 80 or older either have cataracts or have had surgery to get rid of cataracts. 

At first, you may not notice that you have a cataract. But over time, cataracts can make your vision blurry, hazy, or less colorful. You may have trouble reading or doing other everyday activities. 

Over time, cataracts can lead to vision loss.

The good news is that surgery can get rid of cataracts. Cataract surgery is safe and corrects vision problems caused by cataracts.

What are the types of cataracts?
Most cataracts are related to age — they happen because of normal changes in your eyes as you get older. But you can get cataracts for other reasons — like after an eye injury or after surgery for another eye problem (like glaucoma).

No matter what type of cataract you have, you’ll need surgery to treat it.

What are the symptoms of cataracts?
--------------------------------------------------
You might not have any symptoms at first, when cataracts are mild. But as they grow, cataracts can cause changes in your vision. For example, you may notice that:

Your vision is cloudy or blurry
Colors look faded
You can’t see well at night
Lamps, sunlight, or headlights seem too bright
You see a halo around lights
You see double (this sometimes goes away as the cataract gets bigger)
You have to change the prescription for your glasses or contact lenses often
Talk with your eye doctor if you have any of these symptoms — they could also be signs of other eye problems.

How can I prevent cataracts?
--------------------------------------------------
You can take steps to protect your eyes from cataracts:

Protect your eyes from the sun. Wear sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block the sun.
Protect your eyes from injury. While doing activities like using power tools or playing certain sports, wear protective eyewear to protect your eyes from getting accidentally injured.
Quit smoking. If you’re ready to quit, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669) for free support.
Make eye-healthy food choices. Eat plenty of healthy foods — like fruits and vegetables, leafy greens, nuts, and whole grains.
