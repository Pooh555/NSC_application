// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:camera/camera.dart'; // Import the camera package

import 'package:nsc/home.dart';

void main() {
  // Mocking the CameraDescription
  const mockCamera = CameraDescription(
    name: 'mockCamera',
    lensDirection: CameraLensDirection.back,
    sensorOrientation: 0,
  );

  testWidgets('Counter increments smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester
        .pumpWidget(const MyApp(camera: mockCamera)); // Pass the mock camera

    // Verify that our initial UI is as expected.
    expect(find.text('Take a picture'),
        findsOneWidget); // Example text widget to find

    // You can also test other initial UI states as per your actual implementation.

    // Example of interacting with UI elements (not the actual increment test as in your code)
    // Tap on a button or perform other interactions and verify UI changes accordingly.
